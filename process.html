            My first attempt wasn't bad, all things considered. But as I added more I became frustrated by how clunky my code was.

            So I started over! This time, I created a wireframe using basic HTML/CSS to create containers that I filled with content later. The result was much easier to manipulate, but I could tell early on this is not the design I wanted. I searched for website layout examples for inspiration.

            A desire for simplicity and a focus on higher quality images resulted in this, the final product. My goal was to demonstrate what I've learned while making mindful, restrained choices. I relied on the fullscreen backgrounds for visual impact and selected colors that were prominent in both background images. As each version of this site improved, so did I. Persistence pays off.
